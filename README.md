All scripts are run by loading from console. The console for your browser usually is reached by pressing F12. 
Then copy and paste the code into console and hit enter. 
Refresh to remove script. 

These scripts are not cross compatible. Load multiple scripts at your own risk.


----MapAtZoneNotification----

Currently Notifies you when you are at Map At Zone. Browser notifications must be on for it to show. 
A noise will also be played when you reach it. 
When you change your MapAtZone settings, you will be notified again.

Will notify you again when done with farming items or 10 stacks for maps

----Trimps Scripts----
My personal script for filler runs with AT. Script is written for running to Zone 515 with
my settings. I cannot guarantee everything will work to perfection if not using my AT settings.
Use at your own risk.

----wo Raiding----
This is the script I run for dailies. Same disclaimer as above. I eventually plan on combining the
two scripts into one.
